        <h5>Homemade Pizza Dough:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (300g) unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp. granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>7 oz. (105F-115F) warm water</li>

            <li> semolina and all-purpose flour - for dusting the pizza peel</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Pizza Sauce:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup pureed or crushed canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>2-3 fresh garlic cloves - grated with a microplane or pressed</li>
            <li>1 tsp. extra virgin olive oil - plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>2-3 large pinches of kosher salt - to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Toppings:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 tbsp finely grated marmigiano-reggiano cheese - plus more for serving</li>
            <li>7 oz. fresh mozzarella cheese (not packed in water) - cut into 1/2 in. cubes</li>
            <li>5-6 large fresh basil leaves - plus more for garnishing</li>
            <li>dried red pepper flakes - optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare Pizza Dough:</strong>In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the warm water and 
                olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, but don&apost 
                worry.</li>
            <li>Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together and begin to 
                get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) - it should 
                be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top.  After about 3 minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, 
                and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until 
                the dough has doubled in size. Proofing Tip: If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof measuring cup of water in the microwave
                 for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm environment. Remove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has 
                 risen. [If you are preparing the dough in advance, see the note section for freezing instructions.]</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone:</strong>Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 
                inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does not 
                go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using a delicate pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a maximum of 500°F (260°C)</li>
            <li>As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive 
                oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any 
                excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing.</li>
            <li>Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large plate or floured 
                counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Pizza: Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not own a pizza peel, you can try using the back of a half sheet pan - but it is 
                tricky!) with a tablespoon of semolina and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one ball of pizza dough into 
                roughly a 10-inch circle (don&apost worry if its not perfectly uniform). If the dough springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for 
                an additional five minutes. The edges of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin (you should be 
                able to see some light through it if you held it up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking 
                sheet.</li>
            <li>Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon). Using a large spoon, add roughly ½ cup of 
                the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly 
                and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it
                evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, 
                I&aposll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated 
                baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza 
                are golden brown. Note: If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza under the low or medium broil setting, but watch it carefully!
                Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, 
                some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza.</li>
            <li><strong>Serving Tip:</strong>If you&aposre serving two pizzas at once, I recommend placing the cooked pizza on a separate baking sheet while you prepare the 
                other pizza. In the last few minutes of cooking, place the prepared pizza into the oven (on a rack below the pizza stone) so that it is 
                extra hot for serving. Otherwise, I recommend serving one pizza fresh out of the oven, keeping the oven hot, and preparing the second 
                pizza after people have gone through the first one! The pizza will taste great either way, but it is at its prime within minutes out of 
                the oven!.</li>
