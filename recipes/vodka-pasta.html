        <h2>A delicious dish of vodka pasta, best 
        served with a glass of wine.</h3>
        <p>
            Penne alla vodka is a pasta dish made primarily with vodka and penne pasta (or similar shapes such as 
            rigatoni), usually accompanied with heavy cream, crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, onions, and sometimes 
            small meats and vegetables like sausage, pancetta or peas. The pure alcohol helps intensify and accentuate 
            flavors in the dish, among other claims.
        </p>

            The recipe became very popular in Italy and in the United States around the 1980s, when it was offered to 
            discotheque customers. The recipe thus became an icon of the fasionable cuisine of the time, which preferred
            the use of cream in first courses.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 c. tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. vodka</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 lb. tubed pasta, such as penne or rigatoni</li>
            <li>1/2 c. heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesion, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>Basil, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, 
                until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, until paste has coated shallots and 
                garlic and is beginning to darken, 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add vodka to pot and stir to incorporate, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Turn 
                off heat.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al dente. Reserve 2 cups of pasta water 
                before draining.</li>
            <li>Return sauce to medium heat and add 1/4 cup of pasta water and heavy cream, stirring to combine. Add half 
                the Parmesan and stir until melted. Turn off heat and stir in cooked pasta. Fold in remaining Parmesan, 
                adding more pasta water (about a tablespoon at a time) if the sauce is looking dry. Season with salt if 
                needed. Serve topped with more Parmesan and torn basil leaves.</li>
